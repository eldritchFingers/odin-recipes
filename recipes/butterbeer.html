    <p>A beverage which not only looks great, but feels great. It has a unique taste and is excellent to have while you kickback, relax and stream the Harry Potter movies for the n-th time! 50 points to Griffindor!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
 <li>1 cup light or dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoon cider vinegar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup heavy cream, divided</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon rum extract</li>
    <li>4 (12 oz) bottle cream soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the brown sugar and water. Bring to a gentle boil and cook, stirring often, until the mixture reads 240Â°F on a candy thermometer. </li>
        <li>Stir in the butter, salt, vinegar and 1/4 of the heavy cream. Set aside to cool to room temperature. </li>
        <li> Once the mixture has cooled, stir in the rum extract. </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar mixture and the remaining 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Use an electric mixer to beat until just thickened, but not completely whipped, about 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
        <li>To serve: divide the brown sugar mixture between 4 tall glasses (about 1/4 cup for each glass). Add 1/4 cup of cream soda to each glass, then stir to combine. Fill each glass nearly to the top with additional cream soda, then spoon the whipped topping over each.</li>
